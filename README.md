# Predict Steph Curry's Shots

Challenge: Predict Steph Curry's Shots 🏀
For this Challenge, we'll use a dataset with all Steph Curry's NBA field goal attempts from October 2009 through June 2019 (regular season and playoffs). The dataset was collected with the nba_api Python library.

We'll create a model to predict whether Curry will make a shot based on his past perfomance.
